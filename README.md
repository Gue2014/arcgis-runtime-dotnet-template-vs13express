ArcGIS .net runtime 10.2.3 template for Visual Studio 2013 Express

This is just a solution for Visual Studio Express with a simple map using ArcGIS .net runtime version 10.2.3.
Currently (6/10/2014) does not have a template for the Express version of Visual Studio 2013.

You need the esri .net SDK 10.2.3, VS Express 2013 and .net framework 4.5 to make use of this.
